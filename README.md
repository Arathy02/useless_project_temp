# [VIRTUAL FUTURE YOU TIME MACHINE] üéØ

### Project Description
Our project is a futuristic, interactive "Time Machine" web app where users input lifestyle data (sleep, diet, exercise, etc.) to see humorous and exaggerated predictions of their future selves. With an engaging design and animations, the app offers a fun, visually appealing experience using modern web technologies.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Our project solves the completely unnecessary problem of "What will I look like in the future based on my current habits?"‚Äîa fun, exaggerated take on lifestyle choices that no one asked for but everyone can enjoy. It‚Äôs a playful, comical way to visualize the impact of daily habits like sleep, diet, and exercise, turning serious health concerns into entertaining predictions!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We‚Äôre solving this non-existent crisis by building a ‚Äúfuturistic time machine‚Äù that transforms your lifestyle choices into wild, animated predictions of your future self. Forget health trackers! Our app uses sliders and quirky animations to show you if too much junk food means you'll become a walking burger or if too little sleep turns you into a zombie‚Äîbecause, clearly, that‚Äôs what the world really needs!

### Project Demo
# Video
<video controls src="Screen Recording 2024-11-03 102540.mp4" title="Title"></video>
In the demo video, we showcase a streamlined user journey starting from the Home page and leading to a final result display, passing through an interactive questionnaire session. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the flow:

1. Home Page:

The video begins by displaying the Home page interface, where the user is introduced to the purpose of the application. The design is clean and inviting, ensuring ease of navigation.

There might be a prominent Start or Begin button to lead users into the next phase, the questionnaire.


2. Questionnaire Session:

After clicking the Start button, the user is directed to the Questionnaire session.

In this session, the user is presented with a series of questions, one at a time.

Each question might have options like multiple-choice answers, checkboxes, or input fields depending on the nature of the questions.


As the user responds to each question, the interface could offer feedback (such as indicating the current question number or progress through the session).

The design is kept user-friendly, allowing for easy navigation between questions (with options like Next or Previous).


3. Result Display:

Once the questionnaire is completed, the user is redirected to the Result page.

The result page provides an outcome based on the user's answers. This could be a score, a personalized result summary, or a recommendation.

The results might be visually enhanced with graphs, percentages, or textual explanations to give clear feedback.


Summary:

The video demonstrates a smooth user flow from the Home page to the Questionnaire session and finally to the Result display.

It emphasizes interactivity and user engagement through well-designed transitions and clear navigation.

The process ensures users can easily complete the questionnaire and receive meaningful results in a concise, engaging manner.
